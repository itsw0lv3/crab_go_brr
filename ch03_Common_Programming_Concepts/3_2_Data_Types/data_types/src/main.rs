  // chars are four bytes in size and represents a Unicode scalar value, which means it can

              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];

  // You can also init an array to contain the same value for each element by specifying the
  // initial value, followed by a semicolon and then the length on the array
  let arr_three = [3; 5]; // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

  // Accessing index and assigning it to a variable:
  let first_idx = arr[0];
